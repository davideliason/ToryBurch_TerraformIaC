**Description**
This is the working code for building the infrastructure to power the Tony Burch web application. The Tony Burch project is a collaborative effort between At, Pilar, and myself, David Eliason. This is a parallel repo for reference and to allow mrore-robust commenting.

The code structure attempts to modularize code as much as possible, using variables to move away from hard-coding and modules for the parent resource groups.
